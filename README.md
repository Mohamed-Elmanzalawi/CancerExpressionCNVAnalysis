# Computational Analysis of Lung and Kidney Cancer Gene Expressions and CNV Relationships

## Project Overview

This repository documents a collaborative project undertaken by Mohamed El-Manzalawi, Amany Awad, Rania Alanany, and Ahmed Elghamry at Nile University, Egypt. The project, conducted as part of the CIT660: Statistical Analysis and Visualization course, is titled "Computational Analysis of Lung and Kidney Cancer Gene Expressions and their CNV Relationship." The team was under the supervision of Prof. Ibrahim Mohamed Youssef, PhD, from the Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University.

## Project Description

Lung and kidney cancers are the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This project aims to analyze gene expressions in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC). The primary objectives include identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), exploring copy number variations (CNVs), and performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to understand the biological implications.

## Files Structure

- **Code:** R scripts for data filtration, hypothesis testing, GSEA, CNV filtration, regression, and David enrichment analysis.
  
- **Data:** Raw unprocessed data files, including gene expression data, and CNV data.

- **Report:** Comprehensive report detailing project background, objectives, methodology, results, and discussions.

## Instructions for Reproduction

To reproduce the analysis:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-kidney-cancer-analysis.git
2. Open RStudio or any R environment.
3. Execute the R scripts in the Code directory in the provided order to perform data analysis But be sure to change the file paths according to your data location.
4. Refer to the report in the Report directory for detailed results and discussions.
